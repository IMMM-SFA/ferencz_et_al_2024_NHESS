Drought has long posed an existential threat to society. Engineering and technological advancements have enabled the development of complex, interconnected water supply systems that buffer societies from the impacts of drought, enabling growth and prosperity. However, increasing demand from population growth and economic development, combined with potentially more extreme and prolonged droughts due to climate change, pose significant challenges for governments in the 21st Century. A recent severe and prolonged drought during 2008 – 2015 in Texas, United States is used as a case study to assess multisectoral impacts and adaptive response to severe drought. The Lower Colorado Basin is used as the spatial boundary for our analysis. We provide a high-level overview of impacts from the exceptional single-year drought in 2011 and as well as impacts from persistent multiyear drought conditions. Water planning responses are assessed using regional water planning data on planned sectoral supply, volumes and unit cost of demand and supply-side strategies, and planning innovations, both technical (modeling, operational, planning) and policy oriented. Drought impacts were primarily confined to agriculture, landcover, and the environment, and temporary demand management prevented shortages to critical sectors (municipal, industrial, and power). Adaptive responses included growth in planned development of unconventional supplies, large jump in panned municipal conservation, and several planning innovations aimed at improving the region’s preparedness to future drought. While the impacts and responses we present are specific to the Lower Colorado Basin, many of the insights are transferable for understanding drought impacts, multisector challenges, and types of adaptive responses in other economically diverse and rapidly growing regions.
