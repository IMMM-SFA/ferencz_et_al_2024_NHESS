Drought has long posed an existential threat to society. Engineering and technological advancements have enabled the development of complex, interconnected water supply systems that buffer societies from the impacts of drought, enabling growth and prosperity. However, increasing demand from population growth and economic development, combined with potentially more extreme and prolonged droughts due to climate change, pose significant challenges for governments in the 21st Century. The recent severe drought spanning 2008 â€“ 2015 in the Colorado Basin of Texas, United States is used here as a case study to assess multisectoral impacts and responses to severe, multi-year drought. The drought primarily affected the agricultural sector, landcover, and the environment. Shortages to critical sectors (municipal, industrial, and power) were prevented through the combination of aggressive temporary demand management the highly developed regional water supply infrastructure in the basin. A unique aspect of this study is the breadth of analysis, with supporting data from nine different local, state, and federal sources. Besides relevance, an advantage of assessing a recent drought is the abundance of publicly available, high-quality data and information to enable a detailed picture of multisectoral impacts. While the impacts and responses are specific to the Colorado Basin, TX, the basin is grappling with similar water security challenges facing the Western US, such as: groundwater depletion/sustainability, limited resources for agriculture and growing populations, maxed out reservoir capacity.
